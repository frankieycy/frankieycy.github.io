## This site

This is a project hub that hosts my computing projects and classworks, which span physics, computer science and finance. Links below redirect to the GitHub repos and reports. I am a final year physics student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and aim at a financial engineering / financial math postgrad.

## Projects

### Physics

| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Neuronal network analysis<br>(_final year thesis - [PHYS4610](course-info.html#phys4610)_) | (i) recovered neuronal network connectivity from experimental time series data<br>(ii) Explored different network models, analyzed model-generated time series data and drew comparison with experimental data in terms of spiking activities using Python<br>(iii) investigated network features that potentially lead to heavy-tailed spiking activities<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/network) (ongoing project) |
| Crystal geometry optimization<br>(_course project - [PHYS4061](course-info.html#phys4061)_) | (i) implemented a three-body potential (Tersoff potential) on crystals<br>(ii) Optimized crystal geometry by relaxing atomic spacings and positions using steepest gradient and conjugate gradient optimization schemes<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/crystal-optimisation) |
| Molecular simulation<br>(_course project - [PHYS3061](course-info.html#phys3061)_) | (i) simulated the molecular dynamics of an interacting gas under Lennard-Jones potential<br>(ii) investigated the radial distribution of particles and temperature variation when coupled to a heat bath<br>(iii) tested the accuracy of numerous iterative schemes (e.g. Euler, Euler-Cromer, Verlet algorithm) by observing how energy is conserved |
| Crowd simulation<br>(_course project - [PHYS3061](course-info.html#phys3061)_) | (i) Simulated escape panic in different environmental settings by a realistic mechanical model of human interaction that incorporates physical and psychological factors<br>(ii) Analyzed escape efficiency and congestion subject to corridor size, shape and panic parameters<br>[report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GEi4yqK3EG2BpgSe4d0epMcw3zSGdl7h) |
| Nano equilibrium shapes<br>(_CUHK summer intern, 2019_) | Modeled equilibrium shapes of growing 2D nano-materials including MoSe2 and Bi2Se3 by minimizing thermodynamic edge formation energies computed through a quantum mechanical first-principle approach |

### Computer science

| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Graph algorithms<br>(_individual project_) | (i) wrote up a priority queue and graph class in C++<br>(ii) implemented graph search algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path search and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/graph-algorithm) [sample](https://github.com/frankieycy/graph-algorithm/blob/master/main.out) |
| Hex game and AI<br>(_individual project_) | (i) wrote up an interface for the Hex board game in C++, built upon my graph class and algorithms<br>(ii) implemented AI game strategies (e.g. Monte Carlo selection of moves, alpha-beta minimax) for human-machine play<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/hex-game) [sample](https://github.com/frankieycy/hex-game/blob/master/main.out) |

### Finance

| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Technical trading simulation<br>(_course project - [RMSC4002](course-info.html#rmsc4002)_) | (i) Implemented an optimal buy-and-hold trading strategy according to technical indicator $\mu/\sigma^2$, where volatility $\sigma$ is computed from time series models such as EWMA and GARCH(1,1) using R<br>(ii) Performed historical backtesting to analyze returns, Sharpe ratios and risk metrics such as value at risk and expected shortfall<br>[report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18PxDDSq8fbkepGPk4h6fH3ejorru2qzs) |
| Market simulation<br>(_course project - [PHYS4061](course-info.html#phys4061)_) | (i) Modeled stock price dynamics with the Ising spin model from physics (which is comparable to the stock market with mutually interacting participants) through a Monte Carlo simulation approach using C<br>(ii) performed statistical tests to examine resemblance to real data in terms of non-normality, tail distribution and autocorrelation<br>(iii) The model exhibits heavy-tailed returns and autocorrelations that resemble real data<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/ising-stock) [report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nDeWmzLs3zxIkhyL3w2mGlWpbIRBVL5k) |
