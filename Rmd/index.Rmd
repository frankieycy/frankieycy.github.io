## Projects

### Physics

| Topic | My work |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Neuronal network analysis (Python)<br>(Final year project) | (i) Recovered neuronal network connectivity from experimental time series data<br>(ii) Explored different dynamical models of network, analyzed model-generated time series data to extract spikes and drew comparison with experimental data in terms of spiking activities<br>(iii) Investigated network features that potentially lead to heavy-tailed spiking activities through regression and cluster analysis<br>[network model](https://github.com/frankieycy/spiking-neuron-model)<br>[network reconstruction](https://github.com/frankieycy/fncch) |
| Crystal geometry optimization (C)<br>(Course project) | (i) Implemented an empirical three-body potential (Tersoff potential) on crystals that captures atomic angular dependences<br>(ii) Optimized crystal geometry of an initially perturbed configuration of atoms by relaxing atomic spacings and positions using steepest gradient and conjugate gradient optimization schemes that were efficiently coded<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/crystal-optimisation) |
| Molecular simulation (C)<br>(Course project) | (i) Simulated the molecular dynamics of an interacting gas under Lennard-Jones potential<br>(ii) Investigated the radial distribution of particles and temperature variation when coupled to a heat bath<br>(iii) Tested the accuracy of numerous iterative schemes (e.g. Euler, Euler-Cromer, Verlet algorithm) by observing how energy is conserved |
| Dynamical features of escape panic (C)<br>(Course project) | (i) Simulated escape panic in different environmental settings such as a smoky room and a long corridor with obstacles by a realistic mechanical model of human interaction that incorporates physical and psychological factors<br>(ii) Analyzed escape efficiency and congestion subject to corridor size, shape, pedestrian flow and panic parameters<br>(iii) The model recovers real-world crowd behaviors including jams, incoordination and herding tendency |
| Nano-material modeling (VASP)<br>(Research intern) | Modeled equilibrium shapes of growing 2D nano-materials including MoSe2 and Bi2Se3 by minimizing thermodynamic edge formation energies computed through a quantum mechanical first-principle approach |

### Computer science

| Topic | My work |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Hex game and AI (C++)<br>(Individual project) | (i) Wrote up an interface for the Hex board game in C++, built upon my graph class and algorithms<br>(ii) Implemented AI game strategies (e.g. Monte Carlo selection of moves, alpha-beta minimax) for human-machine play<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/hex-game)<br>[sample](https://github.com/frankieycy/hex-game/blob/master/main.out) |
| Graph algorithms (C++)<br>(Individual project) | (i) Wrote up a priority queue and graph class in C++<br>(ii) Implemented graph search algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path search and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/graph-algorithm)<br>[sample](https://github.com/frankieycy/graph-algorithm/blob/master/main.out) |

### Finance

| Topic | My work |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Technical trading simulation (R)<br>(Course project) | (i) Implemented a buy-and-hold trading strategy on Hong Kong equities according to technical indicator $\mu/\sigma^2$ with an optimized threshold, where the moving volatility $\sigma$ was estimated from time series models such as EWMA and GARCH(1,1)<br>(ii) Performed historical backtesting to analyze returns, Sharpe ratios and risk metrics such as value at risk and expected shortfall |
| A spin model of market (C)<br>(Course project) | (i) Applied Monte Carlo simulation to model stock price dynamics with the Ising spin model, which consists of coupled spins with stochastic flip decisions depending on the mean-field spin (this mimics the stock market with interacting participants)<br>(ii) Performed statistical tests to examine resemblance to real data in terms of non-normality, tail distribution and autocorrelation<br>(iii) The model exhibits the “stylized facts” of assets including heavy-tailed returns, long memory and volatility clustering<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/ising-stock) |
