## This site

This is a project hub that hosts my computing projects and classworks, which span physics, computer science and finance. Links below redirect to the GitHub repos and reports. I am a 3rd year physics student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and aim at a financial engineering postgrad.

## Projects

### Physics

| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Crystal geometry optimization<br>(_course project - [PHYS4061](course-info.html#phys4061)_) | (i) implemented a three-body potential (Tersoff potential) on crystals<br>(ii) optimized (or relaxed) crystal geometry such as atomic spacings and positions using steepest gradient and conjugate gradient optimization scheme<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/crystal-optimisation) [report]() |
| Molecular simulation<br>(_course project - [PHYS3061](course-info.html#phys3061)_) | (i) simulated the molecular dynamics of an interacting gas under Lennard-Jones potential<br>(ii) investigated the radial distribution of particles and temperature variation when coupled to a heat bath<br>(iii) tested the accuracy of numerous iterative schemes (e.g. Euler, Euler-Cromer, Verlet algorithm) by observing how energy is conserved |
| Crowd simulation<br>(_course project - [PHYS3061](course-info.html#phys3061)_) | (i) simulated escape panic in different environmental settings (e.g. long corridor, open area) by a mechanical model of human interaction<br>(ii) analyzed the escape efficiency and congestion subject to corridor size and panic parameters<br>[codes]() [report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GEi4yqK3EG2BpgSe4d0epMcw3zSGdl7h) |
| Nano equilibrium shapes<br>(_CUHK summer intern, 2019_) | modeled equilibrium shapes of 2D nano-materials including MoSe2 and Bi2Se3 by minimizing edge formation energies computed with a first-principle, supercomputing approach |

### Computer science

| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Graph algorithms<br>(_individual project_) | (i) wrote up a priority queue and graph class in C++<br>(ii) implemented graph search algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path search and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/graph-algorithm) [sample](https://github.com/frankieycy/graph-algorithm/blob/master/main.out) |
| Hex game and AI<br>(_individual project_) | (i) wrote up an interface for the Hex board game in C++, built upon my graph class and algorithms<br>(ii) implemented AI game strategies (e.g. Monte Carlo selection of moves, alpha-beta minimax) for human-machine play<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/hex-game) [sample](https://github.com/frankieycy/hex-game/blob/master/main.out) (ongoing project) |

### Finance

| Title | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Market simulation<br>(_course project - [PHYS4061](course-info.html#phys4061)_) | (i) modeled stock price dynamics with the Ising spin model from physics by a Monte Carlo approach<br>(ii) performed statistical tests to examine resemblance to real data in terms of non-normality, tail distribution and autocorrelation<br>[codes](https://github.com/frankieycy/ising-stock) [report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nDeWmzLs3zxIkhyL3w2mGlWpbIRBVL5k) |
| Technical trading simulation<br>(_course project - [RMSC4002](course-info.html#rmsc4002)_) | (i) implemented a buy-and-hold trading strategy according to technical indicator $\mu/\sigma^2$, with $\sigma$ computed from EWMA and GARCH(1,1) model<br>(ii) performed historical backtesting to analyze returns and value at risk<br>[codes]() [report](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18PxDDSq8fbkepGPk4h6fH3ejorru2qzs) |
